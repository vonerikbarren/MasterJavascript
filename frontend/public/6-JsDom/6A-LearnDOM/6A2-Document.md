## My Notes to Myself
- With DOM functions specifically, there are 3 ways to attach the Javascript to HTML. They are the following:

1. Finding HTML Elements
2. Changing HTML Elements
3. Adding and Deleting Elements


### 1 - Finding HTML Elements

The document.get.... method is where we start. We can get elements by:
- ID
- TagName
- ClassName


``` Javascript 

document.getElementById(id)
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
document.getElementsByClassName(name)

```
