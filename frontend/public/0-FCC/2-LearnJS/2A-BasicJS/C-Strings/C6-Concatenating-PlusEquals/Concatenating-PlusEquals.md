- We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an
existing string variable. this can be very helpful to break a long string over
several lines. 

Note:
- Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated
strings, so you'll need to add them yourself. 


```JavaScript

// Begin-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
// Example #1:
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second. ";

// Result: "I come first. I come second."
// End-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

// -=-=-=- Break -=-=-=-

// Begin-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
// ...Problem: 
// Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
// String 1: "This is the first sentence. "
// String 2: "This is the second sentence. "
// using the += operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by
// assigning the first string to myStr, then add the second string.
//
// ...My solution:
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. "
myStr += "This is the second sentence."

// End-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
