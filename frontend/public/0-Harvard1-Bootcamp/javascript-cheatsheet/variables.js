// at the start of the script is usually where we declare our variables
// that we know we're going to need.

// variables are defined using the var keyword, followed by the name of
// the variable. Often times when we declare a variable we will also
// set a value at the same time, using a single =

// this variable has no value, but we are defining it so that it can be
// referenced later, and given a value. If you were to console.log this
// variable, it would be considered undefined
var undefinedVariable;

// a string is text within quotes
var stringVariable = "string";

// a number is just a number without quotes. It can also have decimals.
// a number without decimals is called an integer.
var numberVariable = 12;

// a boolean is something that is true or false. Note that true and false
// are lowercase
var booleanVariable = true;
